# My-Personal-Hub
This is my final project of creating a personal hub website with 4 pages to navigate. Check it out!
<h2> Page Description</h2>
This page contains 4 pages: Home page, About-me page, Gallery page, and Contact page. (there is an additional submit page which is for when someone submits the form in contact page for confimation and rating websit)
In Home page you will find some information about the site and general information about me. If you go to about me page, there will be even more specific information such as my interests, goals, and favorites. In Gallery page, you will find some pictures of different cats which two of them are my cats. The contact page is for sharing your concerns or suggestions. There is a form to fill out to you can just simply email me. My email is provided at the end of the page as an alterantive way to contact me. When you submit the form, it will open another page that confirms you have submitted the form successfully. There is the option to go back to home page or submit another response. Plus, you can rate the website there as well. 
That is all about the site. You can check out more by opening the site.
