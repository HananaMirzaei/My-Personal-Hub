                <h2> Who am I? 🫧</h2>
                <p> Hello pals, ready to dive deeper into knowing me?! 🌊 <br> Lets start with a breif introduction. My name is Hanana Mirzaei.I am originally from Ghazni, but currently am living in Kabul. I live in a big family with my grandparents together. I haven't graduated school yet but I continiously engage in different programs to enhance my knowledge and skills.  I am both a student and an instructor teaching English. I have always been passionate about sharing my knowledge about somthing with others. I find explaining concepts interesting. I am a detail-oriented person meaning I care a lot about detail in every situation.<br>  I am a life-long learner who is interested in exploring different ideas and concepts. In general I find Technology interesting, specifically, learning computer languages is captivating. Learning world languages and computer languages both allow me to communicate globally and bring creativity into life.</p>
                <h2> My future goals and My interests 🔮</h2>
                <p> I am in love with cats. I think they are really cute creatures. I do have a cat (you can check out her photo in <a href="./Gallery.html"> (Gallery page).</a> I am interested in spending time alone rather than in a group. In my free time I love to crochet, listen to music, read book, watch youtube videos, and sleep. Solving problems and helping others also peak my interest, so whenever you needed any help don't hesitate to reachout to me. <a href="./contact.html">(Contact me!)</a> </p> 
                <p> Although I haven't decided upon my long-term goals, I would like to get into AI world and contribute by skills and ideas using computer languages and technology concepts. One of my goals is to create my first website soon. In general, this year I want to learn more skills like: computer languages (python,html, CSS, Javasript),Spanish language, Graphic Designing, and Editing videos.</p>
